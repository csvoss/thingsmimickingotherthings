Things Mimicking Other Things
=============================

An interactive exploration of animals, camoflage, and mimicry.

Uses Vivagraph.js to draw an interactive, draggable graph.
Although the page is static, it is updated from basic data using a Python script whenever I add new entries.
To get performance just right, Python Image Library is used to convert images to small thumbnails.
